# Neutrino-Oscillations

This project was done during Desy summer student program, where I have used nuSQuiDS to simulate and calculate neutrino oscalltion probabilities through vacuum, constant matter density and Earth. Also, I have exaimed seveal parameters and how they affect the probabilities including Mass Hierarchy, Octant Angles and CP violation.
